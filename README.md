## Purpose  
The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Share the small projects am building with Go 
- To improve my Go skills and share it with other Gophers
- Hopefully, will work and share some CLI tools too
- and the artistory with ASCII.  

Let‚Äôs Go! 

## Project 01 - Quiz

This project takes inspiration from [gophercises](https://gophercises.com) and brings 
a fun and interactive quiz app right to your console!

### Features:
- Dynamic Question Loading: Users can fetch questions and answers from a .csv file.
- Interactive Gameplay: Questions are presented one by one in the console.
- Real-Time Answers: Users type their answers to respond to the questions.
- Ticking Timer: A countdown timer keeps the adrenaline high! ‚è±Ô∏è When time‚Äôs up, it‚Äôs Game Over.

### What I Learned:
- Channels
- Goroutines
- Channels
- Timer 
- Ticker

## Project 02 - URL Shortner (MUX)
![.](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNmg2djB1MnVjNTJxZHlydHJ5YzExejNiNmpsdXp5MmoyN2F5eHlkdSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/eHLUenDDkeIp5IEPgp/giphy.gif)

A Url shortner is a basic short project that routes the user to the urls using the short urls. 
For example to go to the codeasthetics youtube channel, you will only requred to pass the code asthetics
rather than entering entire url. 

### How it works?:
- Define a map with short URLs as keys and long URLs as values.
- Set up a Go HTTP server that listens to incoming requests.
- Match the requested URL path with the map and redirect if a match is found.
- If no match exists, return a friendly 404 error.

### What I Learned:
- Understanding Go's net/http package and basic routing.
- Gaining insights into gorilla/mux and how it simplifies advanced routing.
- Working with maps, HTTP handlers, YAML, and middleware.
- Understood the concept of MUX - from DLD
